* two thick slices of bacon
* two to three cloves of garlic

2. Warm the pan and once hot throw down your bacon
3. while the bacon cooks, peel your potatoes and quarter them - putting them in the pot of cold water
4. put the pot on to boil - you may add some salt if you want
5. take the bacon off the heat once it's done, and mince the garlic and shallots - perhaps less minced for the shallots
6. chop up the bacon

8. add all of the ingredients into a large bowl and use a electric mixer to whip the potatoes into delicious fluff
