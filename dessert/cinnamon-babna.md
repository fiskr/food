# Cinnamon Babka

Recipe came from [/u/ajp12290](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/4hzofu/babka_eastern_european_pastry_loaf_cinnamon_roll/d2turp4) on Reddit, from a post of a [picture](http://imgur.com/gallery/9jRAAUi) of their creation.

## Ingredients

### Loaf

- 1/2 cup milk, slightly warm
- 2 tsp yeast
- 2/3 cup and 1 1/3 cup All Purpose flour
- 3 oz butter
- 1.5 tsp salt
- ~ 1/3 cup cinnamon
- ~ 1/4 cup sugar
- small amount of oil

### Icing

- powdered sugar
- milk

## Instructions

These were taken directly from the Reddit comments:

Mix the milk, yeast, and flour together and then let sit for 15 mins or until you see the yeast taking effect.
Then beat in 3 oz butter at room temp until incorporated and then an egg along with 1.5 tsp salt.
After that beat in 1 & 1/3 cup flour.
Once smooth (5 or so mins with a stand mixer or until your arm falls off with a whisk and then added kneading) either fridge for up to 6 hours if you have time or roll out immediately.

Roll it out into a large, 15 inch long or so rectangle you want to spread a very very thin layer of oil so the cinnamon and sugar that you then add will stick.
You then want to use your hand to evenly distribute the sugar and cinnamon, enough to to cover the dough about a mm or two high.
Then roll it up!
I like to start tight and roll more loosely each turn for 3.5 "rolls" or pushes I guess.
Once you have your tube you want to cut it in half longwise with a sharp knife and then braid it carefully like a rope.
After that you squish it to fit in a 9in pan lengthwise and leave it in a warm place for juuuust over 2 hours to proof (rise).

Preheat your oven to 350 and then bake for a half hour.
Let sit for at least a half hour before removing from pan and then ice.
My icing is just powdered sugar with enough milk to make the right consistency!
