 

DOUGH - 1 14in. pizza

1 1/2 to 2 cups bread flour, plus more for rolling (Chef's Note: Using bread flour will give you a much crisper crust. If you can't find bread flour, you can substitute it with all-purpose flour which will give you a chewier crust.)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 envelope instant dry yeast (~1/8oz)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cups water, 110 degrees F
1 tablespoon olive oil, plus 1 teaspoon

Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. While the mixer is running, add the water and 1 tablespoon of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.

Grease a large bowl with the remaining 1 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes.

1/4 cup barbecue sauce 
1 tablespoon Concord Grape Jelly 
1/4 teaspoon pepper

1 cup finely shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese blend or Italian cheese blend (4 oz)

Remove from oven.
